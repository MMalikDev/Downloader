## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need either of the following setups:

- Python 3 (recommended: dev version â‰¥ 3.6) and FFmpeg binary installed

  - [Download Python](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

  - [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

OR

- Docker installed

  - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Docker Execution

1. Run the project inside a Docker container:

   ```bash
   bash run.sh -c
   ```

1. To download a video, replace 'URL' below with the desired url:

   ```bash
   bash run.sh -r URL
   ```

> **Note**: When using Windows, utilize WSL to prevent issues with the "cp_docker" command

### Local Python Execution

1. Initialize local environment & activate venv:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r src/requirements/core.txt  # Alternative if errors occur: versions.txt
   ```

1. Initiate the project with a provided link:

   ```bash
   bash run.sh -l URL
   ```

### Executable Creation

1. Ensure Python is accessible in your PATH.

   You may need to add its installation folder to the System Environment Variables.

1. Generate the executable by executing:

   ```bash
   bash run.sh -e
   ```

This process compiles the source code into standalone .exe file suitable for deployment without requiring external libraries.

### Windows Shortcuts

Two .bat files have been prepared for Windows users:

- **'Execute.bat'** will launch the exe file
- **'Download.bat'** will run the Python script

## Additional Information

To get additional help or information, you can use the following command:

```bash
bash run.sh -h
```

This will display a help message that provides more details on how to use the **'run.sh'** script.
